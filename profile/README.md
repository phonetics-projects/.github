## Phonetics Projects

We (Keith Johnson and Ronald Sprouse) started this project page to host some phonetics software projects that we have been working on.

* [`phonlab`](https://github.com/phonetics-projects/phonlab) has software for phonetics research.
* [`file-organize`](https://github.com/phonetics-projects/file-organize) has functions for organizing files in experimental and other research contexts

## Contribution guidelines

We would welcome community involvement - naturally to raise issues or feature requests for the existing software, 
but also to contribute your own software that may be of use to others.  If you would like to add to this project page
please contact us.  Here are some guidelines for contributions.

* license the software allowing redistribution (preferably the Berkeley 3-clause license)
* obey the licenses of any software that is included in your work
* provide documentation (at a minimum a good readme file, good doc strings for public functions, and example scripts.
